## ðŸŒ® taco-shell ðŸŒ®

A drive-thru taco bell simulator ran in your terminal, exapanding what I
learned from the [burrito index program](https://github.com/colinkautz/burrito-index) I wrote.

### Requirements
- Deno
- a love for taco bell

### Instructions
1. run `deno install` where you cloned this repo
2. run `deno run start`
3. follow the prompts (enter a zip, select a store, type in your order)
4. the text parser will attempt to parse your order and print out a receipt
