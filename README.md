## 🌮 taco-shell 🌮

A drive-thru Taco Bell simulator ran in your terminal, expanding on what I
learned from the [burrito index program](https://github.com/colinkautz/burrito-index) I wrote.

### Requirements
- Go 1.21+
- A love for Taco Bell

### Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `go build`
3. Run `./taco-shell` (or `taco-shell.exe` on Windows)
4. Follow the prompts (enter a zip, select a store, type in your order)
5. The text parser will attempt to parse your order and print out a receipt
